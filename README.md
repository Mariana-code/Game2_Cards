# Game2_Cards
Create a small card game that meets the following requirements:\
- Define a scriptable object with the characteristics of a pokemon / yugioh style card (at least attack, name, and a texture).\
- Create 1 prefab that uses the scriptable object to populate the card\
- Create 10 different card definitions and add a manager to your scene from which you can get deck data.\
- At scene startup use random to populate 5 prefabs with 5 different scriptable objects\
- Create a "randomize" button that when pressed redefines the cards in the scene
